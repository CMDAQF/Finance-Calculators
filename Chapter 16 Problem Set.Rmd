This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Given parameters
face_value <- 1000  # Bond face value
coupon_rate <- 0.094  # Coupon rate
coupon_payment <- face_value * coupon_rate  # Annual coupon payment
years <- 3  # Maturity in years

# Cash flows for each year including final principal repayment
cash_flows <- c(rep(coupon_payment, years - 1), coupon_payment + face_value)

# Function to calculate Macaulay Duration
macaulay_duration <- function(cash_flows, ytm, years) {
  # Discounted cash flows and weighted cash flows calculations
  discounted_cash_flows <- sapply(1:years, function(t) cash_flows[t] / ((1 + ytm) ^ t))
  weighted_cash_flows <- sapply(1:years, function(t) (t * cash_flows[t]) / ((1 + ytm) ^ t))
  
  # Macaulay Duration
  duration <- sum(weighted_cash_flows) / sum(discounted_cash_flows)
  return(round(duration, 2))

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
