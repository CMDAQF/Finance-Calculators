## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Problem_2}
rb=2
ri=10

Expected_return = 1*rb+0*10
sd=0.38
Variance =(.2*sd)**2
Variance
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r problem_3}
expected_rate_return = 0.14 #14%
sd =0.35 #35%
tbill = 0.04 #4%
wrisky =0.75
w_rfree =0.25

Er= wrisky*expected_rate_return+ w_rfree*tbill
Er
sd_porfolio= wrisky*sd
sd_porfolio


```
```{r}
expected_rate_return = 0.21
sd =0.33
tbill = 0.07
wrisky =0.75
w_rfree =0.25

((14/1.3)-3)/(14)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
